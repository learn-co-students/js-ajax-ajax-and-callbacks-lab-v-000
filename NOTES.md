We're making a GitHub repository search client.

It should take a user's search terms,

query the GitHub search API for repositories

display the results in the left-hand column

The user can then click various links in each repository to get more detailed information in the right-hand column.

1. Make html link called Search Repositories that calls searchRepositories function - need input for search terms []
2. Create searchRepositories functions []
3. What is `searchTerms` text input and where does it come from []
4. How do I query the GitHub repository search API.[]
